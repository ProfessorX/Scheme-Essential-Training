;; Exports: provide
; By default, all of a moduleâ€™s definitions are private to the module. The provide form
; specifies definitions to be made available where the module is required.

(provide provide-spec ...)

#|
A provide form can only appear at module level (i.e., in the immediate body of a module).
Specifying multiple provide-spec s in a single provide is exactly the same as using mul-
tiple provides each with a single provide-spec .
Each identifier can be exported at most once from a module across all provides within
the module. More precisely, the external name for each export must be distinct; the same
internal binding can be exported multiple times with different external names.

; In its simplest form, a provide-spec indicates a binding within
; its module to be exported. The binding can be from either a local
; definition, or from an import.
