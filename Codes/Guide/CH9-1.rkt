;;; Regular Expressions
#|
A regexp value encapsulates a pattern that is described by a string or byte string. The regexp
matcher tries to match this pattern against (a portion of) another string or byte string, which
we will call the text string, when you call functions like regexp-match. The text string is
treated as raw text, and not as a pattern.
