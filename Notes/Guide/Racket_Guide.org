   - Under the hood, a function definition is really the same as a
     non-function definition, and a function name does not have to be
     used in a function call. A function is just another kind of
     value, though the printed form is necessarily less complete than
     the printed form of a number or string.
   - A function definition can include multiple expressions for the
     functionâ€™s body. In that case, only the value of the last
     expression is returned when the function is called.
